      <h1 data-w-id="Heading" style="opacity:0" class="subtitles-black-booklet">Background</h1>
      <p class="body">The UN Resident Coordinator (RC), when called upon to lead and coordinate an emergency response, is ultimately accountable in his/her humanitarian role to the populations in need – whether designated as a Humanitarian Coordinator or not. When responding to humanitarian emergencies, RCs report directly to the Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC). They should immediately inform the ERC of the emergency, forward available information and consult on the future course of action.<br></p>
      <p class="body"><strong>OCHA Support: </strong>As the RC, your first port of call is the OCHA country office, if one exists. If there is no OCHA presence in your country, contact the OCHA regional office.<br></p>
      <p class="body">At headquarters level, your entry point is the Director of OCHA’s Operations and Advocacy Division, based in New York. For urgent support needs contact the Director of the Coordination Division, based in Geneva. <br></p>
      <h1 data-w-id="9eb4d7ef-bf0f-2c11-08a2-bfd0b398a560" style="opacity:0" class="subtitles-black-booklet">Preparedness</h1>
      <p class="body">Successful humanitarian response is dependent on comprehensive emergency preparedness and effective information management. This ensures that when an international response is required, response mechanisms can be stood up quickly to address gaps where these exist or adapt existing structures to the specific needs of the humanitarian response.<br></p>
      <h1 data-w-id="079c40c6-c53a-f66e-3088-b15323165909" style="opacity:0" class="subtitles-black-booklet">How to use this guide</h1>
      <p class="body">This supplementary guide outlines actions to take at the onset of an emergency – whether it be a natural disaster, an escalation of conflict or a rapid deterioration in humanitarian conditions – and serves as a reminder of actions and events to anticipate during the response. As situations vary, the type and order of activities must be adapted to the context, including the nature of the emergency, the stakeholders and actors involved, the available resources and capacity, and the operational environment. Whatever the context, coordination must take place in a manner that neither undermines adherence to humanitarian principles nor exposes affected populations or humanitarian workers to greater risks.<br></p>

      <p class="body">The following apply to all emergencies, regardless of whether the Government has requested, welcomed or declined international assistance. The RC must:<br></p>
      <p class="body bold-list"><strong>1.</strong> Complement Government action<br></p>
      <ul role="list" class="list-15 bull">
        <li class="body bull">As set out in General Assembly resolution 46/182, each State has the responsibility, first and foremost, to take care of the people affected by emergencies within its territory by initiating, organizing, coordinating and implementing humanitarian assistance.</li>
        <li class="body bull">The RC should support national efforts by leading and coordinating the humanitarian action of relevant organizations in country, whenever possible in coordination with national and local authorities. </li>
        <li class="body bull">States and other relevant actors (such as armed groups party to a conflict) are called upon to facilitate the work of impartial humanitarian organizations in implementing humanitarian assistance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body bold-list"><strong>2.</strong> Promote respect for international humanitarian and human rights law, and humanitarian principles<br></p>
      <ul role="list" class="list-booklet bull">
        <li class="body bull">In all activities, the RC is guided by international humanitarian law (IHL), international human rights law (IHRL) and the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body bold-list"><strong>3.</strong> Be guided by the Principles of Partnership<br></p>
      <ul role="list" class="list-booklet bull">
        <li class="body bull">Relations among organizations involved in humanitarian action are governed by the Principles of Partnership: equality, transparency, results-oriented approach, responsibility and complementarity.

      <p class="body">Based on all available sources, and drawing on baseline information gathered as part of the minimum preparedness actions, develop a preliminary understanding of the scale, urgency and complexity of the crisis. This includes the most urgent and immediate needs of the affected population; the available capacity of national, local, regional and international actors, including of the RC’s office or the OCHA country office; and the potential response and (immediate) resources required. OCHA (or the RC&#x27;s office) supports the compilation of information, with inputs from in-country humanitarian actors if feasible given time constraints. This includes any data, including geospatial data, on affected people; a description of the context, including access, logistics and security; an overview of capacity to respond; the Government’s decision on whether to receive or welcome international assistance; a projection of how the situation may evolve; and any immediate support requirements for the RC&#x27;s office/OCHA. As a matter of urgency, this input can be provided verbally by telephone to the ERC/OCHA regional office.<br></p>

      <p class="sub-bold-five"><strong>Contact the national authorities to coordinate with the relevant Government agencies, other relevant actors and with regional organizations, where applicable.</strong><br></p>
      <p class="body">Ascertain the extent of the crisis and, if needed, contact the relevant Government counterpart and other relevant authorities (e.g. other parties in a conflict) to offer humanitarian services for people affected by the crisis. Promote respect for IHRL and IHL by all parties, including non-State armed groups if applicable. A Government may formally request international assistance, or it may want to avoid public statements of humanitarian need by discreetly accepting offers of aid. Organizations already working in country may consider whether (and how) to re-direct assistance from ongoing programmes to the affected areas, following consultations with the State, other relevant actors and donors. As far as possible, seek cooperation with relevant authorities including daily planning and external briefings, and express continued support for the Government-led response (or the response led by other relevant actors, where appropriate).<br></p>
      <h1 data-w-id="ac9dfa2e-522f-2edd-8cef-a0dd286ae349" style="opacity:0" class="number-1">3</h1>
      <p class="sub-bold-five"><strong>Convene the UN Country Team (UNCT) and initiate coordination structures. If a Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) does not exist, consider establishing one.</strong><br></p>
      <p class="body">Hold regular meetings. The first meeting following the onset of a crisis is critical in setting the direction and establishing the structure of the response. The UNCT (or HCT if established) should:<br></p>
      <ul role="list" class="list-new">
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-34"><strong>(a)</strong></span> review and implement the minimum preparedness actions and/or activate the inter-agency contingency plan (or the international component of the national plan for disaster response);</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-35"><strong>(b)</strong></span> agree on the scale of the crisis, immediate needs and priority sectors/geographic areas;</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-36"><strong>(c)</strong></span> assess response capacity/presence and gaps;</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-37"><strong>(d)</strong></span> review operating conditions, including staff welfare, logistics and access;</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-38"><strong>(e)</strong></span> review existing coordination structures and/or agree new arrangements to fill gaps;</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-39"><strong>(f)</strong></span> determine initial external support and funding needs, and request surge capacity and funding as required;</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-40"><strong>(g)</strong></span> determine sequence/timing of needs assessments, response planning and monitoring. This may include the immediate preparation of a Flash Appeal or other resource mobilization tools if deemed appropriate;</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-41"><strong>(h)</strong></span> agree daily reporting and public information/media engagement procedures, including developing a crisis communication plan and key messages for HQ media and advocacy materials;</li>
        <li class="bodylist new"><span class="text-span-42"><strong>(i)</strong></span> in contexts of high or very high insecurity, a Programme Criticality Assessment (PCA) will be required, and in contexts where it already exists it should be referenced as a result of a change in programmatic conditions (reach out to the PC secretariat for support on this).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body">The RC, in consultation with the UNCT (or HCT), determines the frequency of meetings. In large-scale crises, daily meetings may be necessary. Meeting agendas should focus on the critical issues of the response, particularly delivery. The RC should ensure that the HCT clarifies expectations for leadership on the implementation of the IASC policy on protection, protection from sexual exploitation and abuse (PSEA), accountability to affected people (AAP), gender and gender-based violence (GBV). OCHA (or the RC’s office) serves as the secretariat and provides the necessary backstopping and advice, including information collection and analysis to guide decision-making.<br></p>
      <p class="footnotes"><span class="text-span-11">&gt; Note:</span> If the RC is also the UN Designated Official for Security, all national and international staff should be accounted for and a Security Management Team meeting convened to discuss critical response activities, the security risk assessment and security capacity.<br></p>
      <h1 data-w-id="2789568d-fc15-ab10-7357-699f60d71982" style="opacity:0" class="number-1">4</h1>
      <p class="sub-bold-five"><strong>Meet with in-country donors, diplomatic corps and International Financial Institutions (IFIs). </strong><br></p>
      <p class="body">The RC’s early engagement with donors and in-country diplomatic corps, as well as international financial institutions (IFIs) is critical for indicating (initial) inter-agency funding priorities, funding intentions including bilateral support and use of assets, and to raise the visibility/profile of the crisis. The RC should also maintain an ongoing dialogue with donors on the evolution of needs, results achieved and funding received throughout the response. It is important to keep in mind that the major humanitarian donors tend to take funding decisions within 72 hours of the onset of a crisis. <br></p>
      <h1 data-w-id="f44432e7-143e-53b3-f272-a483d9a33204" style="opacity:0" class="number-1">5</h1>
      <p class="sub-bold-five"><strong>Prepare key messages and advocacy outreach.</strong><br></p>
      <p class="body">Reach out to the media, and in large/medium-scale crises hold a press conference and issue a press release. Speed is critical in the competitive 24/7 news cycle. A media advisory (invitation) and a press release (one-page summary announcing a significant event) should accompany the press conference and be broadly circulated, in local languages whenever possible. When interacting with the media, RCs must be fast and proactive from the outset, emphasizing support to Government efforts (as well as those of other actors where appropriate). There should be no vacuum for others to speculate what the UN and the humanitarian community are doing or not doing. Convey information in plain, clear language – avoid ‘UN speak’, alarmist wording or too many statistics. A key consideration is ‘do no harm’ so that advocacy efforts do not negatively affect access to or the protection of affected people and the credibility of the UN or humanitarian partners.<br></p>
